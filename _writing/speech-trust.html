          <p>
        Good evening and thank you all for having me.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I had just graduated from Oregon State,
        	had completed Navy officer training
        	and was assigned to
        	Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE
        	in San Diego -- The Fleet Angels.
        </p>

        <p>
        I was on one of my first helicopter missions --
        there to take photographs of training
        as part of my duties
        as the squadron’s Public Affairs Officer.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’m proudly wearing my Flight Jacket
        with a Fleet Angels patch
        sewn over my left pocket
        and I’m wearing a borrowed green jumpsuit
        as the air crew straps me into a gunner's belt
        so I can safely lean out
        the helicopter’s side door to take pictures.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I’m on an SH-3 Sea King --
        	the same kind as Marine ONE -
        	the President's helicopter.   
        	Of course ours isn’t as fancy
        	as the one the President uses.  
        	It’s pretty utilitarian.
        	This thing wasn’t sleek.
        	It wasn’t quiet.
        	The pilots called it
        	the War Winnebago.  
        	But it didn’t matter to me.  
        	I was flying and I was on a mission!
        </p>

        <p>
        	So I’m all keyed up
        	to get the best photographs ever.  
        </p>

        <p>
        	Mind you -- I’m not really a photographer.
        	I know how to point -- and shoot.  
        	But still, I’m keyed up.
        	I’m going to get the best photographs
        	this squadron has ever seen!
        </p>

        <p>
        	I’m crouched down shooting here.  
        	Leaning over; shooting there.
        	I get on the helicopter deck
        	and hang my camera out the door to focus
        	on the lowering of a rescue basket
        	when the pilot excitedly barks out
        	some command I don’t understand.
        </p>

        <p>
        And the helicopter violently shifts
        and just starts dropping.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Straight
        	down.
        </p>

        <p>
        Author, TED Talk speaker and optimist
        Simon Sinek says
        “Trust is absolutely essential
        for human survival.”
        </p>

        <p>
        	I couldn’t agree more!  
        	When that helicopter
        	was falling from the sky
        	-- I was freaked out.
        	Momentarily scared beyond all belief.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And yet, it was weird because
        	I trusted the pilot wouldn’t let
        	that War Winnebago crash into the ocean.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Or, if he did,
        	I trusted the aircrew
        	knew how to handle such a crash
        	and that they
        	wouldn’t let us die.
        </p>

        <p>
        	In the military
        	we require that type of trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We have to believe
        	in the person next to us.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We have to believe in our training
        	and experience and
        	all the rules and procedures.
        	Because if we didn't,
        	fear would grip us
        	and prevent us from doing our job.
        </p>

        <p>
        	How could you face the enemy
        	in a combat zone
        	if you didn't trust
        	the Marine next to you?  
        </p>

        <p>
        	How could you land a jet
        	on an aircraft carrier at night
        	if you didn't trust the people on deck
        	guiding you in safely?  
        </p>

        <p>
        	How could you trust flying
        	an aircraft more than 20 years old
        	if you didn't trust the maintenance crew?  
        </p>

        <p>
        	Our entire profession
        	is built on a chain of trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	That chain is created through
        	our training,
        	our shared culture and language,
        	a common mission and purpose,
        	through professional
        	and personal relationships,
        	and shared experiences
        	-- good and bad;
        	fast-paced and exciting;
        	and monotonous and
        	watching-paint-dry boring.
        </p>

        <p>
        	That chain of trust
        	has been tested through war, peace,
        	military budget increases and cuts,
        	and cultural shifts in the military
        	and America.  
        </p>

        <p>
        	And through each test,
        	it gets stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
        	My experience,
        	twenty-some years ago
        	on that helicopter was,
        	for me,
        	one of those tests.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        For what seemed like the longest
        two or three seconds of my life,
        we just dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Closer
        	and closer
        	to the ocean.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And then,
        	in an instant,
        	we were just hovering in the air
        	about 40 feet above the waves.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The pilot was laughing.
        	The aircrew were smiling.  
        </p>

        <p>
        	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
        	It was routine.
        	Part of the training.  
        	I wasn’t in on it…
        	I was the newbie.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Not warning me ahead of time
        	that they were going to radically maneuver
        	their helicopter to prepare
        	for a simulated rescue was a little joke
        	they played with all the newbies.
        </p>

        <p>
        	It is part of our military culture
        	and I’ll never forget that experience,
        	the capability of that aircraft
        	and the ability of those pilots.
        </p>

        <p>
        We strengthened our chain of trust that day.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        Simon Sinek says trust comes
        from a sense of common values and beliefs.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Using that definition,
        	the military is on some
        	pretty solid trust ground.
        </p>

        <p>
        	But what happens if you don’t share
        	common values and beliefs?  
        </p>

        <p>
        	Does it automatically equate to distrust?  
        	Looking around today’s environment,
        	it sure seems it’s starting to look that way.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The giant PR firm Edelman conducts
        	a worldwide trust survey each year
        	and they say there’s a widening trust gap
        	between the mass population
        	and what Edelman calls the informed public
        	-- those who are college-educated,
        	fall in the top 25 percent income bracket
        	and report significant media consumption.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Edelman says the informed public
        	-- 15 percent of the world population --
        	reports increased trust in government,
        	media, business and NGOs.
        </p>

        <p>
        	While everyone else -- 85 percent of world --
        	reports less than 50 percent trust
        	in those institutions.
        </p>

        <p>
        	For communicators, members of the media
        	and those in the public service sector
        	-- for us in this room --
        	the trust gap presents a major challenge.  
        	We NEED the mass population to trust us.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        The Navy believes the American public
        has a right to know about their Navy.  
        They should be able to see how we are using
        the resources they provide
        -- their sons, daughters, husbands and wives;
        and, through Congress,
        the funds that support
        our platforms, programs and operations.
        </p>

        <p>
        	If we lose the trust of the American people,
        	we won’t be able to do our job
        	protecting our country and our interests.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We need Americans to trust
        	and believe in the Navy
        	so they are open to receive information
        	about what we are doing
        	and why it’s important to them
        	so we can recruit smart and innovative thinkers
        	to make us stronger
        	so we can diversify our ranks
        	to take advantage
        	of their unique backgrounds and experiences.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	As institutional trust has fallen to historic lows,
        	a new kind of trust is growing.   
        	It’s being called “peer trust”
        	and I believe institutions – even the Navy –
        	can learn a lot by looking at
        	how this type of trust works.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We’re all already familiar with in it in some way.   
        	Airbnb, Uber, Etsy, Yelp!,
        	They’re the new model of peer trust.
        	They are all built on decentralized,
        	bottom-up, personal reviews
        	and online reputations.
        	Trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We believe crowd-sourced reviews on Yelp!.
        	We care about our Airbnb guest reputation.
        	We develop almost personal relationships
        	with our Etsy artisans.
        	We care about our Uber rating.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Trust in this context is
        	not linear nor controlled by a single source.
        	It works up and down; between provider and customer.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And this type of crowdsourced trust is growing.
        	A major reason is because
        	of the transparency of the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The provider is transparent
        	about what they are going to provide
        	-- room,  ride, rustic hand-made gift.  
        	And the customer is transparent
        	about who they are, what they want,
        	and what kind of customer they’ve been in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Over time, with many reviews and ratings,
        	a reputation picture becomes clear
        	for both provider and customer.
        	Everyone knows what they can expect
        	and trust is further built
        	when both live up to or exceed the expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
        	At a fundamental level,
        	transparent transactions may be why the Navy
        	-- and the military -- enjoys high levels
        	of public trust and confidence.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The role of our Navy is to protect America.  
        	And if required, to fight and win.  
        	And through time, there have been clearly visible
        	transactions that have built our reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	- At-sea battles and amphibious landings
        	in the Pacific during World War Two; 
        </p>

        <p>
        	- Missile strikes from ships at sea into Baghdad
        	to help liberate Kuwait or to take out
        	terrorist cells in Afghanistan; 
        </p>

        <p>
        	- Humanitarian relief operations in Indonesia,
        	Thailand and many other countries
        	after the 2004 Tsunami; 
        </p>

        <p>
        - The rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates; 
        </p>

        <p>
        - The raid that brought down Osama bin Laden 
        </p>

        <p>
        	- Navy Medal of Honor recipient Senior Chief
        	Edward Byers and his rescue of an American
        	hostage in Afghanistan. 
        </p>

        <p>
        	We demonstrate our competence to the American public
        	and to the world during each transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
        	But even as powerful as those events are,
        	they wouldn’t be able to help the Navy build trust
        	without some level of transparency
        	so our customers could see those actions,
        	understand their context
        	and make their own decision
        	on whether the Navy is meeting the standard.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The Navy's customer is the American people,
        	so we must communicate with them
        	to close this transactional loop
        	and, hopefully, over time, build trust
        	and understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
        	This is my job for the Navy.
        	And to do it properly,
        	me and my team of Navy communicators,
        	develop relationships with a host of partners
        	and stakeholders:
        	the media, other government agencies,
        	elected officials, business, local communities
        	and non-governmental organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
        	In a lot of ways,
        	working with and building trust
        	with all those different groups
        	is like building peer trust
        	on Uber, Airbnb or Etsy.  
        </p>

        <p>
        	Except instead of an online collection
        	of reviews and ratings,
        	you build a chain of trust
        	linked by personal and professional relationships
        	and grounded by character and competence.
        </p>

        <p>
        	This chain of trust
        	starts by extending your own trust
        	to someone you don’t know
        	or maybe only know by reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	You then have to understand
        	the role they play
        	and their expectation
        	for whatever transaction
        	you’re working to achieve.  
        	To do that,
        	you have to demonstrate respect,
        	seek to understand their environment,
        	their language and their culture.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And you have to be real.
        	Being authentic and transparent
        	is key to building trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	All this takes time:
        	Whether it’s building
        	your personal reputation online,
        	or demonstrating your competence
        	through consistently solid work
        	and showcasing your character
        	through choices made
        	when nobody's watching.
        </p>

        <p>
        	All of this became very evident to me
        	-- and life changing important
        	to a group of reporters back in 2011.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I was on the USS Mount Whitney,
        	the command ship for the Navy’s SIXTH FLEET.
        </p>

        <p>
        	My job was to explain to the media
        	and to the public what we were doing and why.  
        	Now, this is fairly straight-forward
        	when it’s just the U.S. Navy.
        </p>

        <p>
        	But this was OPERATION ODYSSEY DAWN
        	-- a multi-agency,  multinational task force
        	brought together initially
        	to conduct humanitarian missions in Libya.  
        	The scope of the mission changed
        	from non-kinetic humanitarian evacuation flights
        	to kinetic attacks against Gaddafi's military forces
        	to stop human rights abuses.
        </p>

        <p>
        	ecause I needed to provide context
        	about what was happening on the ground,
        	I had to fully understand the why’s behind
        	the kinetic operation.
        	To do that,
        	I needed to build a relationship with the Targeteer
        	-- the person responsible
        	for selecting air campaign targets
        	based on intelligence reports.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And since I was the person providing information
        	to the media, the Targeteer had an interest
        	to ensure I had all the right information
        	and a full understanding of what was going on.
        </p>

        <p>
        	So we began to work together.
        	I asked probably an annoying amount of questions
        	about his job.
        	He asked about the challenges of mine.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We both sought to understand
        	each other’s world better.
        	We had lunch and talked about our families.
        	We told each other stories.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Through all this interaction
        	-- professional and personal --
        	I was able to see the Targeteer’s
        	character and competence.
        	He was able to assess mine.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I extended trust.
        	I listened to and sought to understand
        	his role and his expectations for my mine.
        	I was me -- my authentic self, warts and all.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And in a short amount of time,
        	we developed mutual trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The same pattern had been repeated
        	over and over again with members of the media
        	throughout my career.  
        	Since I had been stationed
        	in the Pentagon multiple times,
        	I had solid relationships
        	with many in the Pentagon Press Corps.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The trust I had developed
        	with them became incredibly important
        	during Operation Odyssey Dawn.  
        	In my mind, that trust contributed
        	to probably one of the most
        	important decisions I ever made.
        </p>

        <p>
        	A Pentagon Press Corps reporter
        	I had known for many years called me
        	and after our initial greetings and how are you’s,
        	 his voice got real serious.
        </p>

        <p>
        	“So Dawn, I just wanted to let you know
        	that we have a group of reporters
        	traveling with Gaddafi’s forces
        	from city A to city B tonight.
        	They’re being taken
        	in white vans
        	to see a supposed bombing site….”
        </p>

        <p>
        	Without saying it, but, you know,
        	kind of saying it, this reporter
        	was telling me this information
        	because he knew me
        	and knew I’d get it to the right people
        	in order to keep the reporters
        	in those vans safe.
        </p>

        <p>
        	You see, Gaddafi had been moving
        	his military forces,
        	weapons and ammo around
        	from city to city in white vans.
        </p>

        <p>
        	They were legitimate targets
        	and Gaddafi knew it’d be a propaganda victory
        	if the West mistakenly killed a group of reporters.
        	So he was playing a sort of white van shell game
        	with reporters and his military.
        </p>

        <p>
        	During that day’s targeting meeting,
        	white vans from city A to city B
        	were on the target list.
        </p>

        <p>
        	My heart started pounding.
        	Could it be the vans with those reporters?
        	Can we turn off these strikes?
        	What if the vans
        	are carrying Gaddafi’s troops instead?
        </p>

        <p>
        	I talked to the Targeteer.
        	Explained what I knew
        	and how I knew it. Transparency.
        	And the strikes were turned off.  
        	The reporters made it safely
        	to a site Gaddafi said was bombed
        	by the West
        	and where many civilians were killed. Not true.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And I felt an incredible sense of relief.  
        	Fear did not grip me. We did the right thing.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And even without shared cultures
        	and shared missions and purpose,
        	the media and the military trusted each other.  
        	And we did the right thing.
        	If you think about it,
        	a lot of chains of trust were flexed that night.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The reporters on the ground in Libya
        	trusted someone in the Pentagon Press Corps.
        	That reporter trusted me.
        	I trusted the Targeteer
        	and he, in turn, trusted me.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Mutual respect.
        	Understanding.
        	Trust.
        </p>

        <p>
        	It all counts
        	--- whether you’re flying in helicopters,
        	trying to catch a ride on Uber,
        	renting a house on Airbnb
        	or working in a combat zone
        	-- developing trust
        	is the most important thing
        	we can ever do with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thank you.
        </p>
