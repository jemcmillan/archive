        		I was running many ideas through my mind
        		about what I wanted to say to you on your graduation
        		from the course here at Syracuse.
        </p>

        <p>
        As part of very effective procrastination campaign,
        I started watching HBOs “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck”
        documentary.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ve always been fascinated by people who create
        and make new things by combining things
        we never thought could --- or should -- be combined.
        </p>

        <p>
        Nirvana was like that for me.
        </p>

        <p>
        Light and Heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pop and Punk.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I had heard sort-of similar music before -- like the Pixies --
        	but it never really reached me --
        	it never communicated to me in the way Nirvana did
        	-- and at times -- does.
        </p>

        <p>
        	So this documentary grabbed my attention.
        	The story was interesting to me.
        	But the way the documentary was told fascinated me.
        </p>

        <p>
        	It’s authentic with the expected home videos.
        	It’s full of context with multiple interviews
        	with family and friends
        	and their 20 years of hindsight and reflection.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And then there’s what really got me:
        	Kurt Cobain’s art.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Audio recordings of him telling stories
        	and working through his creative process of making music.
        	Animated segments of sketches
        	and drawings from Cobain’s notebooks.
        	Sections highlighting his letters,
        	journal entries, lyrics
        	and random thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Kurt Cobain was a mixed media artist.
        	He wrote. He drew. He designed. And he made music.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Seeing his work --
        	and hearing more than just his published songs --
        	provided me a new way to understand his story.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	This is something many of us in the Navy
        	have been thinking about.
        	How can we provide a new way
        	to help people better understand our story?
        </p>

        <p>
        	Part of the answer is you -- our Syracuse graduates.
        	We believe the education you receive here --
        	and the mentorship you will provide
        	to others when you leave --
        	can help us tell our story better.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Your work in storytelling through multimedia,
        	writing, sound production, design, photojournalism
        	and broadcasting builds a tremendous foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The challenge for each of you will be
        	how you apply all this when you return to the Fleet.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Will you be able to translate
        	the storytelling skills you developed here
        	to the types of stories
        	you’ll be asked to produce in the Fleet?
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	It reminds me of a story
        	a famous musician found himself
        	in back in the late 1700s.
        </p>

        <p>
        	At the age of 17 or 18, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
        	landed a job in Salzburg, Austria
        	as the court musician and composer.
        </p>

        <p>
        	This was a job his father had set up
        	with the Archbishop in order to keep a steady flow
        	of money coming into the Mozart family.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The job though didn’t sit well with Mozart.
        	He had spent his youth travelling Europe
        	with his family playing for Kings and Queens,
        	meeting and learning from the leading minds in music,
        	playing and composing in every conceivable genre,
        	listening to the best orchestras,
        	and watching Italian Operas.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And now he was relegated to life in Salzburg.
        	Isolated from the European centers of music.
        	Asked to play and compose music he felt
        	was dead and conventional
        	and had no way of stirring emotions
        	or being expressive.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I guess you can say Mozart was being asked
        	to compose something like
        	a Navy dot Mil story
        	or a general military news article for his time.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He ended up moving to Vienna though
        	where he began creating at an intense rate.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He used the knowledge he gained travelling Europe
        	and playing all those different genres to his advantage.
        	He started to stretch the boundaries
        	of traditional music and transform those songs
        	in ways no one had ever heard.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He found ways to make his music powerful and expressive
        	and broke away from the style of music
        	people had grown to expect.
        </p>

        <p>
        	You see, back then the piano concerto and symphony
        	had become light and pop-like genres
        	with short and simple movements and a lot of melody.
        	To Mozart, it all must have sounded
        	a lot like elevator music.
        </p>

        <p>
        	So, Mozart reworked those forms from within.
        	He composed works for larger orchestras.
        	He expanded the violin sections.
        	His works gave the orchestra a more powerful sound
        	and he established tension and dissonance
        	that would build and build to a climax
        	and then reveal a grand
        	and dramatic finale.
        </p>

        <p>
        Light and Heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pop and Punk.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	We’re trying to create something similar for the Navy.
        	Let’s say it’s our version
        	of Light and Heavy.
        	Pop and Punk.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We’re on a mission
        	to create Navy content that is both.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We need fast and easy-to-digest content.
        	Quick. Light. “Ok. Got it”- type stories,
        	information summaries,
        	short videos,
        	informational posters.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Content that is like pop music:
        	Accessible to many;
        	easy to understand
        	and easy to remember.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Content that is mobile,
        	social, visual and shareable.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Content that is produced
        	and released now -- as it happens.
        	Not in an hour. Not in a day.  But now.
        	As quick as we can get it out
        	and be accurate and clear.
        </p>

        <p>
        You know. Pop music.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	A musician who’s been really good
        	at getting in on the “now” is Sonny Moore.
        	He was the lead singer of the band “From First to Last”
        	from 2004 to 2006.
        </p>

        <p>
        	The group mixed Emo and Hardcore --
        	imagine confessional and expressive lyrics
        	with fast, heavy and abrasive punk.
        	It’s a different way of thinking about light and heavy.
        	Pop and Punk.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Well, Sonny was plugged in.
        	He met his band on MySpace
        	when it was the largest social networking site
        	in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
        	They marketed their album through social media
        	and started booking shows
        	through connections they made online.
        </p>

        <p>
        	As social media began to break
        	and become a monster force,
        	so did “From First To Last.”
        </p>

        <p>
        	They were booked on the Vans Warped Tour
        	and got bigger and bigger
        	as they promoted their social media pages
        	at all their concerts.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Of course, trends move fast.
        	MySpace died. “From First To Last” faded.
        	And Sonny Moore left the band,
        	rented a warehouse in L.A.
        	and started playing on his computer.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He started creating Electronic Dance Music
        	and posting it online for free.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He continued to promote his work on social media
        	and started playing parties.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He was offered a major breakthrough job
        	remixing a Lady Gaga song…
        	and started calling himself Skrillex.
        </p>

        <p>
        	His take on electronic dance music
        	and dubstep became big.
        	Very big.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He took the genre to a new place
        	as he mixed pop dance music with heavy deep bass drops
        	and wobble that became his signature sound.
        </p>

        <p>
        Light and Heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
        Pop and Punk.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	What’s amazing about Skrillex to me
        	is how he has been able to ride
        	on different pop and punk waves
        	and his ability to combine mulitple trends.
        </p>

        <p>
        	What’s also amazing is
        	he doesn’t stick with just one way.
        	He moves in and out of trends
        	and finds new ways
        	to connect with his fans.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Skrillex understands that pop trends shift.
        	What’s popular and meaningful now
        	may not be useful in a day.
        </p>

        <p>
        The shelf-life of pop is natually short.
        </p>

        <p>
        	As we create our pop stories
        	that are accessible to many;
        	easy to understand
        	and easy to remember;
        	we can’t forget that much of it is disposable.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Content that is mobile, social, visual and shareable
        	is also inheritantly expendable.
        </p>

        <p>
        	I have no idea what was in my Twitter feed an hour ago.
        	I never scroll all the way down my Facebook feed
        	to see what happened yesterday.
        </p>

        <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

        <p>
        	This is why we need the heavy.
        	In addition to the Pop, we need the Punk.
        </p>

        <p>
        	And this is where you
        	and the particular skills you learned here
        	come in to play the most.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Mozart’s expanded orchestras and violin sections
        	are like storytelling details and color.
        	It adds richness and context.
        	It fills the mind
        	and can create powerful,
        	moving experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Skrillex’s way of understaning
        	what resonates with crowds
        	allows him to connect to people
        	through both rock
        	and electronic dance music.
        </p>

        <p>
        	Working in mixed media
        	and telling our stories through
        	sounds, graphics,
        	moving pictures, still images
        	and written words
        	can provide a depth of understanding --
        	a holistic look inside, around, above and below
        	the stories we tell.
        	Like Kurt Cobain’s mixed media art --
        	the more ways we can share,
        	the more ways people will have to understand us.
        </p>

        <p>
        	We need to create these deeper, more contextual
        	pieces of work that resonate with our audiences.
        	The work can take many forms:
        	Written, audio, video
        	or multimedia feature stories or series;
        	Storytelling narratives;
        	Full on documentaries;
        	Detailed and data-driven stories and infographics.

        <p>
        	Head out to the Fleet
        	and embrace both the Pop and the Punk.
        	Listen and seek to understand your audiences.
        	Find ways to resonate with them

        	by combining styles, media,
