          Juan Bernal Hernandez says it’s hard for him to attend the daily protests at the Rota gate.
          He worries about seeing his American boss or American neighbors come through.
          He worries they might think all this is somehow against them.
          He insists it’s not.
          </p>

          <p>
          Juan and around 50 other Spanish base employees are spending much of their Sunday at
          Rota’s City Hall protesting the local government much like they’ve been
          protesting at the base gates.  Juan explains that their goal is to get both
          the U.S. and Spanish governments to correct a pay situation that has effectively
          lowered the take-home pay for nearly 1,300 Spanish base employees.
          </p>

          <p>
          “What we’re doing with the Comite [the coordinating committee for the labor unions]
          and the demonstrations is all we can do.  Spain is much different, and going
          through lawyers and placing a claim against the government would take forever,”
          he says.  “A union for you is like a Mafia.  For us, it’s the only thing we have.
          The legal system here is not what you have in the States.”</p>

          <p>
          That’s why Juan Bernal, a housing inspector for the housing department
          for nearly eight years, is peacefully protesting here and will continue
          to protest at the Rota gate.  He says it’s something he doesn’t enjoy,
          but feels he has to do.  “I suffer a lot when I have to go to the demonstrations.
          It goes against my personality, but I think it’s the only way.”</p>

          <p>
          He wants the two governments to do something that will bring his take-home
          pay back up to the level he was earning in December.  On Friday he received
          his pay summary for January.  “I calculated yesterday that it’s 37,800
          pesetas less than what I earned in July of last year.”
          That’s about $230.00. “For us that’s a lot of money.”
          </p>

          <p>
          Opening up a computer spreadsheet program, Juan reveals his monthly
          and annual budget.  He was paid 174,316 ptas. in January and has
          bills that add up to 208,513 ptas. – a deficit of 34,197 ptas.
          “I still have savings right now,” he says as he goes through
          accounts he has to cancel: Mobile phone, Internet, and
          additional medical insurance for his family. “I have five mil
          going to a savings account for my son.  That’s something I don’t
          want to cancel – but…” He pauses and looks over the numbers.
          “Who knows for now.  The other things are things I don’t
          really need anyway.”</p>

          <p>
          The change in his pay has forced Juan to look at how he lives.
          He’s started walking to work each day to save on gas money,
          the family won’t be taking their traditional Sunday outings
          for tapas, and he’s thinking he should sell off his motorcycle.
          “Until I can accommodate to the new situation, I’ll be using my
          savings.  I was planning on using that money to finish renovating
          our home,” he says.</p>

          <p>
          That renovation project on his 16-year-old house began a few years
          ago, but the bulk of it – the part that cost the most – was
          done last year.  “We’re paying 52,000 ptas. a month on that
          loan,” he says.  “I’ve put all my dreams in this house.
          I’ve been here every day doing the concrete, putting in the
          tiles and we finally feel like we have something that’s ours,”
          he says.</p>

          <p>
          All that work and coming so close to finishing a project that
          would have given him and his family their dream home makes it
          that much harder to face the fact that one of his options for
          the future might mean selling his home.</p>

          <p>
          “If I have to sell my house – I put all my dreams there.
          If we have to sell it, it’s like going backwards in life.”</p>

          <p>
          Other options Juan is considering are quitting his job on base
          and finding work elsewhere – probably Madrid where the job market
          is better.  His wife may also try to get a job but she’s still
          studying for a psychology degree – courses that she has to stop
          taking because it will now cost the family 100,000 ptas. a year
          in tuition costs.</p>

       <p>
        “There’s a fear for the future.  Definitely,” he says as he thinks
        about the options in front of him.  He doesn’t want to move to Madrid –
        he and wife made the choice to leave that city in 1992 and come back to
        Rota for a better quality of life.  He doesn’t want to sell his house.
        He’s not sure if his wife will be able to find work.</p>

        <p>
          “There’s a feeling of depression,” he says while studying his budget.
          “Every bill you have is important.  These are things that are here
          and I can’t do anything about it.”    He says he feels the stress
          24 hours a day and he wakes up every three or four hours.
          He keeps going through the numbers checking and double checking
          trying to find a place to cut that extra $230.</p>

        <p>
          For now he’s placing his dreams with the labor unions and with the
          protests in hopes their voices will be heard and the U.S. and Spanish
          governments will do something that’ll raise his real-wages back to
          their pre-Jan. 1, 2000 levels.
          </p>

          <p>
          “It’s a political issue, not a personal issue,” he says.
          “I try to disconnect from the problem when I’m at work because
          my boss is not responsible, nor are my customers.  But it’s hard
          for you to continue sometimes because your head is so full of these problems.”
          </p>

          <p>
          But Juan Bernal Hernandez continues.
          He walked to work this morning, stood outside the gates for a
          while and then went to the office hoping it made some difference.</p>
