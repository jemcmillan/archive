          <p>
          		Thank you for that introduction.
          		Let’s start with a joke:
          </p>

          <p>
          Cortana, Alexa and Siri were having
          a conversation with each other.
          </p>

          <p>
          Cortana said:  
          “You know, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian
          are examples of negative-concord languages.”
          </p>

          <p>
          Alexa retorted:  
          “Actually, Russian, Neapolitan and English
          are also languages where multiple negatives
          affirm each other.”
          </p>

          <p>
          	Cortana then replied,
          	“Oh yeah,  well, there's no language
          	where a double positive makes a negative.”
          </p>

          <p>
          Siri chimes in: “Yeah, right.”
          </p>

          <p>
          Appears their databases weren't aligned.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	In addition to not being able to tell a joke,  
          	I am probably not the best person to talk
          	about the future of communication.
          </p>

          <p>
          	I've deleted my Instagram from my phone,
          	my last Tweet was April 16
          	and my last Facebook post was June 14.
          </p>

          <p>
          	My Snapchat Score is 76
          	and I have only four trophies.
          </p>

          <p>
          	By all metrics you could use,
          	I'm a communicator who doesn't communicate
          	the way people are communicating today.
          </p>

          <p>
          So, my starting point isn’t normal.
          </p>

          <p>
          	To talk about what’s next
          	for our community,
          	I think we need to break it down into
          	The Near Future and
          	The Far Future.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	The MC merger prepared us well for the
          	online, social, video and multimedia storytelling
          	we’ve seen and continue to see
          	in the communication space.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Today, a large portion of our work is about
          	our people and our events.
          	It’s media coverage based off
          	the principles of news gathering, reporting
          	and feature storytelling.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This focus has served us well.  
          	Our commanders in the Fleet have
          	encouraged, expected, and
          	eventually exulted our work.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Armed with an MC, their command could
          	get the recognition they deserve.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But the tools of technology today
          	are minimizing the need to have
          	a professional take photographs,
          	post a quick video,
          	or send a note back home to the family
          	on the command social media page.
          </p>

          <p>
          	All of us know that we need
          	a professional force of communicators
          	To uphold standards of
          	security, accuracy, propriety and policy.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But as the military budgets get tighter,
          	as manpower gets reduced,
          	and tough decisions
          	about what to keep or lose
          	encroach on our community,
          	we will need to be more
          	than the Sailors who
          	cover people and events.
          </p>

          <p>
          	In the near future,
          	our focus needs to shift
          	to becoming the Sailors
          	who use communication
          	to directly help
          	solve command issues and problems.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We must be able to add direct value
          	to achieving the commander’s intent.  
          	At all levels within the organization.
          </p>

          <p>
          	To help us shift our focus,
          	we are introducing
          	a communication model
          	that focuses on understanding
          	the commander’s intent;
          	defining the issue to solve;
          	coming up with multiple ways
          	of solving that issue
          	through communication;
          	creating the content
          	and then evaluating the effects.
          </p>

          <p>
          		It’s called the DICE model.
          </p>

          <ul class="speech">
          	<li class="space">D for Define</li>
          	<li class="space">I for ideate solutions</li>

          	<li class="space">E for evaluate effects</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          	In addition to a slightly
          	different approach to
          	our thinking process,
          	the near future will bring
          	better communication tools
          	and techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We will work with a new Navy
          	content publishing system
          	that brings all our content pieces
          	into one place that is
          	structured;
          	search engine optimized;
          	publishes to a unit’s social media platform;
          	and is adaptable and responsive
          	so it’ll work on any device -
          	desktop, mobile, wearable,
          	virtual or augmented reality.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Our web developers at DMA
          	just recently coded Navy.mil so
          	our news stories show up
          	as Facebook Instant Articles.  
          	The presentation is amazing and fast.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Our near future will require us to
          	rapidly update our digital tools
          	and work flow process
          	to adapt to new ways
          	of presenting information.
          </p>

          <p>
          	As we focus on the commander’s intent
          	and communicate targeted,
          	more specific information,
          	more of our work will center
          	around collecting facts and data
          	and cleaning and ordering that information
          	for use in releasable data sets,
          	data-driven stories,
          	infographics and visualizations.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Our skills as information designers
          	-- the practice of presenting information
          	in a way that fosters efficient
          	and effective understanding of it --
          	will become key to the Navy.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	So the near future isn’t too different.  
          	It’s just better.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But the far future
          	is going to get a little weird.
          	It’s where everything changes.
          </p>

          <p>
          	In the far future,
          	Artificial Intelligence systems
          	will talk to each other
          	and share their knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Microsoft’s  Cortana;
          	Amazon’s Alexa;
          	Apple’s Siri;
          	IBM’s Watson and
          	Google’s “Hey Google”
          	and whoever, whatever comes next
          	will all contribute
          	knowledge to the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The internet will be everywhere.
          	It won’t be a place you go.
          	It will just exist.  
          	In our cars, our home appliances,
          	our lights, our contact lenses.
          </p>

          <p>
          	It will exist just about everywhere
          	as sensors become routine parts
          	of tools, toys, tableware.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Whatever can be measured
          	and provide data
          	will be connected.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The internet of things will
          	measure, record, and report
          	everything.
          </p>

          <p>
          	And machine learning systems
          	will take in all that data
          	process, perceive
          	and realign algorithms
          	to increase effectiveness
          	and efficiencies.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Already, Automated Insights
          	is changing the content world
          	with their program called
          	“WordSmith” -
          	An artificial intelligence platform
          	that generates human-sounding
          	narratives from data.  
          </p>

          <p>
          	Their website says their program created
          	over one billion pieces of targeted,
          	personalized content just last year.
          </p>

          <p>
          	You’ve probably seen their work --
          	AP, the Associated Press,
          	uses WordSmith for
          	much of their financial news.  
          	Yahoo! uses it for their Fantasy sports content.
          </p>

          <p>
          	A Google engineer gave a TED Talk in May
          	called “How computers are learning to be creative.”  
          	He demonstrated how Google’s AI can understand
          	what it sees by mimicking how the brain functions.
          </p>

          <p>
          	A device points at a bird and the AI says
          	that’s a bird and can then
          	even identify the species.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But the AI can also reverse the process.  
          	Take all it knows about how to identify a bird
          	and output a likeness of a bird
          	from nothing but data.  
          	Like output a bird
          	from computer memories.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Research and development of
          	autonomous drones and advanced robotics;
          	digital modeling and fabrication,
          	to include 3D printing;
          	virtual and augmented reality;
          	biotechnology and bioinformatics;
          	and nanotechnology
          	will change everything in the far future.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The CNO was just in the Silicon Valley
          	and visited Singularity University
          	where they are
          	researching, prototyping and developing
          	all this and more now.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The University takes its name from the concept
          	called the Technological Singularity,
          	where computers
          	and AI possess a superintelligence
          	that far distances themselves
          	from human intelligence
          	and no longer need humans
          	to guide their own
          	machine learning.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This is where the rate
          	of technological advance grows
          	exponentially.
          </p>

          <p>
          	And don’t worry,
          	when this Singularity happens
          	it’s not going to turn into something
          	like Skynet from the Terminator movies.
          </p>

          <p>
          It’s actually more freaky than that.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Inventor and futurist Ray Kurtzveil
          	gave a TED Talk in 2014 about Hybrid Thinking
          	where he predicts we’re going to be able to expand
          	our neocortex -- the part of our brain
          	that handles sensory perception, spatial reasoning,
          	conscious thought and language --
          	with nanobots that connect our own neocortex
          	to the cloud -- to the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We will all have the potential
          	to tap into the singularity,
          	to join in any conversation
          	with Cortana, Alexa or Siri.
          </p>

          <p>
          What does all this mean for us?  
          </p>

          <p>
          	It means your Navy is going to change
          	dramatically during your career.
          </p>

          <p>
          	I believe the Near Future is now
          	and will continue for five to ten years.

          <p>
          	Then the far future arrives,
          	the pace of change accelerates
          	and within 15 to 20 years,
          	our world will be completely different
          	in ways we can’t imagine.
          </p>

          <p>
          The tools we use will change.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Machines will perform the repetitive tasks
          	we do today faster and better.  
          	Basic news writing, captioning images,
          	sending updates to families,
          	documenting daily military life and operations.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Sensors, cameras and microphones
          	will be everywhere and will be fed back
          	to collection points to be run through algorithms
          	to determine what to do with it all.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This is where I believe our job
          	will take on incredible importance.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Trained communicators, designers, photographers,
          	writers and multimedia storytellers
          	will instruct the machines on what is important
          	to pull from the exabytes of data
          	and share with leaders, families and friends.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We will need trained storytellers
          	to extract information from massive datasets
          	of images, audio and video files and transcripts.
          </p>

          <p>
          And from that mountain of data, tell a story.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Throughout time, no matter what technological
          	revolution occurred,
          	humans have relied on stories
          	to teach, motivate, and inspire.
          </p>

          <p>
          	So no matter what happens
          	in the near or far future,
          	the Navy will always need talented storytellers.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The tools may change over time.  
          	The focus of our efforts may also change.
          	But the need for story does not.
          </p>

          <p>
          Happy 10th Anniversary MCs!
          </p>

          <p>
          	Continue to find, tell and share incredible stories.
          	Push the boundaries of our tools and our craft.
          </p>

          <p>
          	I can’t wait to see
          	what you all will do with the next ten years!
          </p>

          <p>
          Thank you.
