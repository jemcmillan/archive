         <p>
         		Thank you. Thank you for having me here
         		today to celebrate our Navy’s 242nd birthday.
         </p>

         <p>
         	“Here's to the crazy ones.  
         	The misfits.  The rebels.
         	The troublemakers.
         	The round pegs in the square holes.
         	The ones who see things differently.”
         </p>

         <p>
         	Yeah, that’s from Apple’s iconic “Think Different” ad
         	and it kept playing in my mind as I thought about
         	what I wanted to share with you
         	today on our Navy’s 242nd Birthday.
         </p>

         <p>
         	You see, our Navy was built
         	-- and continues to thrive --
         	because we ‘think different’.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Creativity, design, and story
         	are natural components of
         	our history and heritage.
         </p>

          <p>
         	It goes all the back to our very beginning
         	when a renegade Quaker from Philadelphia
         	convinced Secretary of War Henry Knox
         	to take a chance on a
         	radical new ship design.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
         Joshua Humphreys was a crazy one.
         </p>

          <p>
         	His frigate design went against
         	every prevailing belief
         	about Navy ship construction.
         	Most shipfitters slandered the plans.
         	Others who saw them believed they
         	must have been drawn wrong because
         	no one in their right mind
         	would design a ship in such a way.
         </p>

          <p>
         	It was 1794 and Congress had authorized
         	the building of six frigates.
         	It was a contentious vote because
         	nearly half of the elected officials
         	believed we only needed a Navy
         	for coastal defense.
         	The other half believed
         	we needed a blue-ocean Navy
         	to protect Americans
         	and American interests
         	overseas from the Barbary pirates
         	and other potential threats.
         </p>

          <p>
         	One thing everyone at the time agreed on though
         	was that the Royal British Navy was a beast.  
         	It was respected and feared around the world.
         	It had been operating for centuries and
         	had six hundred active warships.
         </p>

          <p>
         	It’d be foolish for anyone to ever think
         	America’s Navy could compete against such might.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Joshua Humphreys must have been foolish then,
         	because he saw things differently.
         </p>

          <p>
         	He believed the American Navy could hold its own
         	against any enemy with the right ship design.
         </p>

          <p>
         	He believed America needed to build a hybrid between
         	the frigates and battleships of the Royal Navy.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Ian Toll writes in his excellent book
         	“Six Frigates” that
         	Humphrey’s “unique insight was that the Europeans,
         	with their binary fleets composed of battleships
         	and smaller frigates, had failed to grasp
         	the advantage of ships
         	that combined qualities of both.”
         </p>

          <p>
         	He also believed that their oversight exposed
         	“a tactical weakness that could be exploited
         	by the Americans in the event of a naval war.”
         </p>

          <p>
         	Mind you, this is 1794 -- more than a decade
         	after the Revolutionary War ended -- and
         	nearly 20 years before the War of 1812 began.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
         	Joshua Humphreys was the crazy one
         	who believed that with the right design,
         	American Sailors and ships
         	could compete against the British.
         </p>

          <p>
         	So he designed a ship that could:
         	outgun the European frigates;
         	overwhelm a lone enemy cruiser with a
         	heavy battery of 24-pounder long guns;
         	and either outrun heavy British battleships,
         	or could take them on in heavy weather
         	when the battleship was forced
         	to stow its lower deck guns.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Humphreys designed a frigate
         	he believed would enjoy
         	one of the most important advantages
         	any warship could ever have:
         	Giving the Commander Options.
         	The option to either fight or flee,
         	to outgun or outrun.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
         	He was putting a round peg into the square hole
         	of British dominance on the sea.
         </p>

          <p>
         And his radical ideas didn’t stop with this concept.
         </p>

          <p>
         	His large, heavily armed, fast-sailing ships
         	would be longer than any frigate on the ocean
         	and they would be built using
         	an innovative way to
         	distribute the weight of the ship
         	across the entire keel.
         </p>

          <p>
         	That innovation would allow it to carry more guns
         	per displacement than any other ship in the water.
         </p>

          <p>
         	To make it happen, his design called
         	for making the beams and decks
         	out of Carolina pine.  
         	The planks of red cedar.  
         	And most important,
         	key pieces of the frame
         	made of southern live oak.
         </p>

         <p>
         	Live oak is the heaviest oak there is.
         	As the tree grows, its vascular system
         	is plugged with a thick gum,
         	making it dense and as heavy
         	as 75 pounds per cubic foot.
         </p>

          <p>
         	It’s extraordinarily strong and has an
         	amazing resistance to both salt air and rot.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Even though it had all these amazing qualities
         	that made it ideal for shipbuilding,
         	it wasn’t used much because it was
         	expensive and hard to obtain.
         	At the time, southern live oak
         	was found only in a twenty-mile-wide coastal zone
         	that stretched from southern Virginia to East Texas.
         </p>

         <p>
         	Humphrey’s genius wasn’t that he was
         	a great ship designer or builder
         	-- even though he was both.
         	His genius was he sought to understand
         	the nature of the problem --- large
         	European Battleships and smaller,
         	but much faster European Frigates --
         	and then used his skills to solve that problem.
         </p>

          <p>
         	He was also a master of the elements
         	of shipbuilding.
         	He knew the characteristics
         	of different types of timber
         	and selected combinations that would give him
         	the exact ship he wanted --- strong and fast.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Three years after getting the approval
         	to build the Navy’s first six frigates,
         	three were completed and launched in 1797.  
         	The remaining three were completed
         	two to three years later.
         </p>

          <p>
         	The genius of their design, however,
         	wasn’t fully recognized until 1812 though.  
         	War had broken out with the British and
         	they flooded American waters
         	with hundreds of warships.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
         	Everyone thought the American Navy
         	would be embarrassed at sea
         	-- but Humphreys ships did exactly
         	what he believed they could do:  
         	outgun or outrun the enemy.
         </p>

          <p>
         	In one battle off the coast
         	of Nova Scotia,
         	the HMS Guerriere closed in
         	on one of Humphrey's
         	frigates and let off a broadside.
         	The ship’s heavy planks and live oak frame
         	provided good protection
         	and as one of Guerrière’s
         	18-pounder balls bounced
         	harmlessly back into the sea,
         	an American Sailor exclaimed:
         	“Her sides are made of iron!”
         </p>

          <p>
         	The remark was widely reported in the press,
         	and USS CONSTITUTION’s nickname “Old Ironsides” stuck.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Our Navy history has so many amazing stories
         	of those who dared to think different.
         </p>

          <p>
         We place a high premium on freethinkers.
         </p>

          <p>
         	We value Freedom of Navigation on the seas
         	and also in the mind.
         </p>

          <p>
         	We are not afraid to innovate
         	or try something new.
         </p>

          <p>
         	Take a look at all the Mass Communication
         	Specialists here today.  
         	Each of you are a product of innovation.  
         	The merging of four legacy ratings into
         	MC was innovative at the time.
         </p>

          <p>
         	You know, Humphrey’s story reminds me
         	a lot of MCs in some other ways.
         </p>

          <p>
         	You all are a lot like Humphrey’s Frigates.  
         	You’re a hybrid bunch.
         	Powerful visual communicators,
         	agile designers,
         	and able to provide your commander
         	a range of communication options
         	executed smartly and swiftly.
         </p>

          <p>
         	The challenge for each you now
         	is to embrace your role
         	and keep learning to become
         	a master of your craft
         	So you can be the crazy one;
         	The round peg in the square hole
         	The one who see things differently.
         </p>

          <p>
         And shape our Navy’s history.
         </p>

         <p>
         Happy 242th Birthday U.S. Navy.
