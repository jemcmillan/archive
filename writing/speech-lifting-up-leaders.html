         <p>
           Thank you.  
           What an incredible honor to be here this morning.

           Thank you [introduction]
           and a very big thank you to the organizers
           for this amazing program.
         </p>

         <p>
         As I was looking through the schedule of events,
         I saw you have a session later today called
         “Lifting Up the Next Generation of Women”.
         A diverse panel of
         smart, strong and dedicated Navy leaders --
         all of whom are women  --
         are leading that discussion.
         </p>

         <p>
         I believe it’s an incredibly important topic
         because, if there’s anything I’ve learned
         in my 26 years of Naval service,
         it's none of us get where we’re at
         alone.
         </p>

         <p>
         And in my life, perhaps
         one of the most personally rewarding challenges
         I faced came
         not from a war,
         not on the ocean,
         and not in the corridors of the Pentagon.
         </p>

         <p>
         It came from completing a
         12-mile
         Icy-water
         Mud-packed
         Electric-shock-filled
         “Why am I doing this?”
         extreme endurance event.
         </p>

         <p>
         With a group of Swim Moms.
         </p>

         <p>
         Before I did that event,
         I could have never imagined myself participating
         in an extreme obstacle course.
         </p>

         <p>
         I don’t like mud.
         I don’t like being cold.
         and I don’t particularly like being shocked.  
         By anything.
         </p>

         <p>
         But there we were.  
         I was watching my daughters Alexis, then 16,
         Shannon and Danielle, my twins, then 13,
         at swim team practice in Naples, Italy
         and I agreed to join a team of Swim Moms
         to do an upcoming Tough Mudder in London.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

         <p>
         I need to be honest with you all,
         I was scared to death
         about running that course.
         </p>

         <p>
         I had no idea
         what I was really getting myself into
         but I knew I wanted to train hard
         and prepare myself for that event.
         </p>

         <p>
         I had to make a very conscious decision
         to make time to do this --
         you know, life gets crazy-busy
         with work,
         three girls,
         a husband
         and a dog.
         </p>

         <p>
         But
         I chose
         to make this a priority
         because
         I wanted this for me
         and our team.
         </p>

         <p>
         Goals are important to me.  
         I believe it’s important to clearly identify
         what you want to achieve.
         </p>

         <p>
         If you can envision the end-state you desire,
         you can then focus
         your energy and efforts to achieve it.
         </p>

         <p>
         I also believe that the best goals
         need to be big.
         They should be challenging and feel
         just out of reach.
         </p>

         <p>
         For this Tough Mudder, our goal was
         to simply finish the event.
         </p>

         <p>
         Just committing to this
         pushed us
         out of our comfort zone.
         We weren’t extreme racers.
         We weren’t fitness fanatics.
         </p>

         <p>
         We were swim Moms.  
         and, in the end,
         we wanted to finish together.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

         <p>
         With the concept of success
         clear in my mind,
         I next needed to identify
         what defeat would look like.
         </p>

         <p>
         You see, when setting big,
         ambitious goals --
         When shooting for your own “Moonshot” --
         It’s quite possible
         you won’t achieve the stated goal.
         </p>

         <p>
         And that’s okay.
         It doesn’t mean defeat.
         The journey itself has
         immense value.
         </p>

         <p>
         To help deal
         with all the setbacks in life --
         to help understand
         it’s okay to try,
         fail and then try again --
         to help condition ourselves to
         an iterative approach
         to attaining our goals
         through trial and error,
         we have to accept that
         small failures are part of the process,
         and those failures don’t equal defeat.
         </p>

         <p>
         You see,
         defeat is a mindset.
         It happens when you’ve given up
         and can’t find a lesson
         to learn in the experience,
         and can’t find
         any value in the journey.
         </p>

         <p>
         Our group of Swim Moms knew
         we might not be able to
         complete every race obstacle.
         We knew someone could get hurt
         and not be able to finish.
         </p>

         <p>
         And we knew
         that if we faced
         any of those challenges,
         We’d be disappointed,
         But not defeated.
         </p>

         <p>
         Success for us was to finish the course
         on our own terms,
         within our own abilities.
         </p>

         <p>
         Defeat could only occur if
         we didn’t even try,
         or
         if we didn’t help each other
         be
         our best self
         on that day.
         </p>

         <p>
         So I trained.
         </p>

         <p>
         We
         would not
         be
         defeated.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

         <p>
         In the end though,
         none of my training
         prepared me for that course.
         </p>

         <p>
         The obstacles were more challenging
         than I’d thought.
         The water much colder
         than I thought I could handle.
         The distance felt much, much, much longer
         than the stated 12 miles.
         </p>

         <p>
         But
         we pushed and pulled,
         Lifted and motivated each other
         with
         words
         and interlocked arms.
         </p>

         <p>
         Each of us made a choice
         time after time
         to continue on
         And earn each step
         Conquer each obstacle
         And do something we weren’t 100% sure
         we could do.
         </p>

         <p>
         We chose to lean on each other
         when needed
         And support each other
         when called upon
         to finish
         as a team.
         </p>

         <p>
         It’s been like that
         throughout my career in the Navy too.
         </p>

         <p>
         All my successes are because someone --
         a strong mentor,
         a caring shipmate,
         a cohort of women facing the same challenges,
         opportunities and choices as me,
         helped me on the way.
         </p>

         <p>
         It is important for
         all of us
         to build
         plenty of time into our days and weeks
         for our families,
         and for us to cultivate and grow
         strong and enduring relationships
         with a highly diverse group
         of shipmates and friends.
         </p>

         <p>
         These relationships,
         built
         on a foundation of
         trust, empathy, respect and synergy,
         and a belief that
         the more you give to others
         the more you’ll receive back in life,
         provide a strong support network,
         with a deep bench of
         knowledge, experiences, and perspectives
         to guide, correct, lift, push and pull
         us when needed in life.
         </p>

         <p>
         I am proud of my service to the U.S. Navy
         and I feel good about
         my personal accomplishments,
         </p>

         <p>
         But what makes me most proud,
         touches me to my soul
         and rewards me beyond
         any personal accomplishment,
         is knowing I’ve helped others.
         </p>

         <p>
         Knowing I’ve helped others
         through challenging moments
         in their lives,
         over obstacles they thought
         they couldn’t pass,
         and with choices that seemed
         impossible to navigate,
         are what I count
         as my most rewarding successes.
         </p>

         <p>
         It is meaningless to reach the top of anything
         and stand there alone.
         </p>

         <p>
         There is no victory
         if there is no one to share it with.
         </p>

         <p>
         And no victory is worth celebrating
         If you can’t help others join you at the top.
         </p>

         <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

         <p>
         Climbing up that Tough Mudder wall was like that.
         It took all of us to make it up that
         muddy, slippery, seemingly impossible obstacle.
         </p>

         <p>
         We pushed and pulled each other up
         and over.
         It took time. And many falls.
         But we did it.
         </p>

         <p>
         And when the last of us reached that top --
         we knew
         we could do
         anything.
         </p>

         <p>
         As I look around this room,
         I see an amazing group of Servicewomen,
         and opportunity after opportunity
         for each of you to add to your own network
         of diverse friends, shipmates and mentors.
         </p>

         <p>
         All that’s left
         is to choose your next big goal;
         To set your own ‘Moonshot’;
         start working to achieve it.
         </p>

         <p>
         And help others achieve theirs.
         </p>

         <p>
         To push and pull,
         Lift and motivate each other
         Help with the next step
         and guide someone over their next obstacle.
         </p>

         <p>
         If you’re first to the top,
         reach down and pull someone up with you.
         </p>

         <p>
         And if you’re still climbing and someone is ahead,
         do what you can
         to push them further.
         </p>

         <p>
         We’re in this together…
         and we can all reach the top
         -- achieve our goals --
         by Lifting Up and helping
         the Next Generation Of Women Leaders.
         </p>

         <p>
         Thank you.
