          	<i>On screen: “There is a war out there, old friend- a World War.
          		And it’s not about whose got the most bullets;
          		it’s about who controls the information.”
          		Cosmo, Ben Kingsley’s character
          		in the 1992 Film “Sneakers”</i>
          </p>

          <p>
          	Not much has changed since 1992 except
          	maybe this quote is even more relevant.
          </p>

          <p>
          		We see it all around the information environment.
          </p>

          <p>
          	ISIS online recruiting;
          	Russian propaganda;
          	Chinese political warfare.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Information is its own warfare domain
          	and our competitors and adversaries
          	are waging battle there every minute of every day.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We are very good at influencing and controlling
          	two of the three dimensions of the information domain:
          </p>

          <p>
          	the physical --
          	networks, Command and Control facilities,
          	communication towers, phones,
          	computers and such;
          </p>

          <p>
          	and the informational --
          		the collecting, processing, storing,
          		disseminating and protecting of information.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But we’re not very good at influencing and controlling
          	the third dimension of the information domain:
          </p>

          <p>
          	the cognitive dimension --
          	how people process and perceive information,
          	make judgments,
          	and make decisions on what to think
          	and what to believe.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We lag in this dimension
          	partly because
          	it’s not in our culture
          	and partly because
          	our narrative lacks focus.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We're not going to change the culture part;
          	nor should we.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Since 1791 and
          	the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights,
          	we’ve enjoyed
          	Freedom of Speech
          	and Freedom of the Press guarantees.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Where our adversaries shut down legitimate
          	news and press coverage,
          	or intimidate,
          	silence,
          	or even kill dissidents,
          	we believe our country is stronger
          	with a free press
          	and with
          	freedom of speech.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We can however,
          	focus our narrative.
          </p>

          <p>
          	It is imperative for us to communicate
          	the overarching narrative of
          	the United States of America
          	and link everything we do
          	and everything we say
          	to that narrative.
          </p>

          <p>
          	To do that, I believe we have three communication obligations:
          </p>

          <p>
          	One, to be transparent about our operations;
          	and deliver Operational Truth.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Two, to ensure what we say
          	aligns with what we do;
          	and build Transactional Trust.
          </p>

          <p>
          	and three, to demonstrate who we are, as Sailors and Americans;
          	by Reinforcing our Values in all our communication.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	So what do I mean by “Operational Truth”?
          </p>

          <p>
           It means aggressive transparency.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We must be able to tell and show the world what we are doing and why.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We must be proactive
          	in our communication planning
          	so we are able to get
          	operational truth out
          	into the information environment first
          	and deny our competitors and adversaries
          	informational maneuvering space.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Being first matters.
          </p>

          <p>
          	A RAND study on the Russian propaganda model says
          	Russia has the agility to be first
          	and that gives them the chance
          	to create a first impression
          	and follow it up with
          	continuous multi-channel messaging
          	which helps them boost their perceived credibility,
          	expertise and trustworthiness.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	<i>On Screen: “Russian propaganda has the agility to be first,
          	which affords propagandists the opportunity to create
          	the first impression. Then, the combination of high-volume,
          	multichannel, and continuous messaging makes Russian themes
          	more likely to be familiar to their audiences,
          	which gives them a boost in terms of perceived credibility,
          	expertise, and trustworthiness.”</i>
          </p>

          <p>
          	To combat this, we need to immediately be able to tell and show
          	our part of the National narrative when asked.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This means
          	we have an obligation to make
          	publicly releasable information
          	available to national leadership
          	to provide context,
          	facilitate informed perceptions,
          	and counter adversarial propaganda.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Our units must be able to
          	collect, process and forward for release,
          	traditional VI like handheld imagery
          	from specialized units like
          	SNOOPIE, COMCAM and NPASE,
          	or non-traditional VI
          	from sensors on manned, unmanned
          	and remotely piloted platforms
          	or other appropriate data
          	from GPS to radar tracks.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We have to view this information
          	as a non-kinetic payload
          	and empower our communication team
          	-- IO and PA –
          	to look at every exercise,
          	operation or expected encounter
          	through this lens.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We also need to consider when it’s appropriate
          	to be more aggressive with releasing information
          	about upcoming exercises and operations.
          </p>

          <p>
          	U.S. SIXTH FLEET did this in June
          	when USS Porter was sent into the Black Sea.
          	They announced on June 4th the intent to send Porter
          	into the Black Sea.
          </p>

          <p>
          	On June 6th they announced Porter had entered
          	and then on the 18th, that Porter had departed.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Partly because of these releases,
          	Russia’s informational maneuver space was limited.
          	It’s a smart use of communication strategy
          	and aggressive transparency.
          </p>

          <p>
          	It also helps us build transactional trust.
          </p>

          <p class="speech-center"> - - - </p>

          <p>
          	Which brings me to our second communication obligation:
          </p>

          <p>
          	We need to ensure what we say
          	aligns with what we do.
          	In doing so, we will build
          	transactional trust.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This is trust built over time by being transparent
          	and closing transactional loops – big or small.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We see it all the time with the peer-to-peer economy.
          	Yelp!, Airbnb, Uber.
          </p>

          <p>
          	They’re the new model of peer trust
          	and they’re built on decentralized,
          	bottom-up, personal reviews and online reputations.
          	Transactional Trust.
          </p>

          <p>
          	People believe crowd-sourced reviews on Yelp!.
          	They care about their Airbnb guest reputation
          	and Uber passenger rating.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Trust in this context is not linear
          	nor is it controlled by a single source.
          	It works up and down; between provider and customer.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This type of peer trust is growing
          	and transparency is a major reason why.
          	Doing what you say you’re going to do
          	builds transactional trust.
          </p>

          <p>
          	At a fundamental level,
          	our Navy’s own transparent transactions
          	may be why Gallup surveys for more than 20 years
          	show high levels of public trust
          	and confidence for our service.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Our role is to deploy where needed,
          	remain ready to fight and win wars,
          	and protect America.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Through time, there have been clearly visible
          	transactions that have built our reputation:
          </p>

          <p>
          	At-sea battles during World War Two
          	The rescue of Captain Phillips
          	The raid that brought down Osama bin Laden
          	Missile strikes from the sea to protect our Country.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We demonstrate our ability to protect America
          	through each transaction.
          </p>

          <p>
          	But even as powerful as those events are,
          	they wouldn’t be able to help
          	the Navy build transactional trust
          	without some level of transparency
          	so people could see those actions,
          	understand their context
          	and make their own decision
          	on whether the Navy is meeting their expectations.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This is why we communicate with our publics.
          	We have to close the transactional loop
          	to continue to build trust and understanding over time.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The PR firm Edelman conducts
          	a worldwide trust survey each year.
          	Their 2016 report – researched in October of 2015 --
          	divides the world into two groups:
          </p>

          <p>
          	The Informed Public --
          	college-educated, top 25 percent income earners
          	with significant media consumption habits;
          </p>

          <p>
          	and then everyone else –
          	the mass public,  85% of the world population.
          </p>

          <p>
          	Edelman’s research shows a growing gap
          	between how these two groups view institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Informed Public reports
            62 percent trust in
            government, media, business and NGOs,
            while the mass population reports
            less than 50 percent trust
            in those institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
          	And these surveys were taken a year ago.
          	Before BREXIT.
          	Before the Presidential Primaries
          	and before the General Election season.
          </p>

          <p>
          	It’ll be interesting to see how those events
          	shape trust levels.
          </p>

          <p>
          	From my seat, it’s alarming to see
          	that 85 percent of the world’s population
          	distrusts these mainstay institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
          	This is the audience our adversaries
          	are targeting in their information war.
          </p>

          <p>
          	And it’s not just ‘over there’ in the Middle East,
          	Russia or China – they’re also targeting us ---
          	our mass population -- right here, right now.
          </p>

          <p>
          	There are two effective ways of combating
          	adversarial propaganda and cyber recruiting.
          </p>

          <p>
          	One is continuing to close our ‘say-do’ gap
          	and build and expand our transactional trust
          	relationships.
          </p>

          <p>
          	The other is providing an alternative to the narrative
          	our competitors and adversaries peddle online.

          	We do that by highlighting
          	who we are and what we believe;

          	Our Navy is a shining example of
          	opportunity and progress,
          	collaboration and acceptance,
          	of being an important part
          	of something bigger than yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We value Toughness, Honesty, Initiative, and Innovation
          	and demand Honor, Courage and Commitment.

          </p>

          	We need to tell that story.
          	It’ll help us combat our adversaries propaganda

          	Addressing all three dimensions
          	of the information domain
          	is vital for our ability
          	to Project Power Ashore through
          	information and communication.
          </p>

          <p>
          	We are very good at influencing
          	the physical and informational dimensions,
          	but face challenges
          	working within the cognitive dimension.
          </p>

          <p>And to change that, we must:</p>

              <li>Focus our narrative</li>
              <li>Deliver Operational Truth</li>
